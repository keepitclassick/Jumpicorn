# Jumpicorn

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through this project, I learned how to work with sprite sheets, how to animate NPC's, collision detection and how to incorporate media.

## How to play

- Use the arrow keys to move the player. Space is a high jump, the up arrow is a small jump.
- Clear out the bats before you run out of lives!
- For every 5 bats cleared, you gain one life, but watch out, when a bat passes the left side of the screen you lose a life!
- The game ends when you get 20 points, or run out of lives.
