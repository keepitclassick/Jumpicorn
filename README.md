#Jumpicorn

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through this project, I learned how to work with sprite sheets, how to animate NPC's, collision detection and how to incorporate media. 

#How to play 

<ul> Use the arrow keys to move the player. Space is a high jump, the up arrow is a small jump.
  <ul> Clear out the bats before you run out of lives!
    <ul> For every 5 bats cleared, you gain one life, but watch out, when a bat passes the left side of the screen you lose a life!
      <ul>The game ends when you get 20 points, or run out of lives.
